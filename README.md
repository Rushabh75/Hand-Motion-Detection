This is a simple hand motion detection code where the model will detect perticular motions like Swiping Left, Swiping right and zoom in. The link to the dataset is given above.

I have used Tensorflow, Keras, sklearn and cv2 as main libraries in python. The training model.ipynb file is used to train the model and save the trained model in a .h5 file then the test.py is used to get the trained model and use opencv to test the model.
